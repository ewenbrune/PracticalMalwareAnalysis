Moreover, the list of imported functions is very short.

We have no indication about what packer was used and UPX tells us that the exe file was not packed by it.  

I used the tool ```Detect it easy``` to detect what packer was used.

It seems like the FSG packer was used. I found very little information online on how to unpack FSG 1.0, It seems possible with ollydgb but the version I am using does not correspond to the tutorial I found and the requiered functionalities were missing.
